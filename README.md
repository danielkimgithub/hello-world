First Repository

Hey Fam,

I'm out here to always be learning, to be somebody, to be myself.
Life is full of opportunities, take it when you can.
I am hoping that I learn some basic and common github commands such as but not limited to init, add, status, commit, reeat, log, branch, checkout, and merge.
